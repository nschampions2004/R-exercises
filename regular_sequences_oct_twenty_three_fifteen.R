#solution for example 1
#Using the seq() function, generate the sequence  2, 5, 8, 11.
seq(2,11,3)

#solution for example 2
#Use the seq() function to generate the sequence  9, 18, 27, 36, 45.
seq(9,45,9)


#solution for example 3
#Generate the sequence  9, 18, 27, 36, 45, 54, 63, 72, 81, 90  using the  length.out  parameter.
seq(9, by = 9, length.out = 10)

#solution for example 4
#For this exercise, first write down your answer, without using R. Then, check your answer using R.
#What is the output for the code:
seq(from = -10, to = 10, length.out = 5)

#solution for example 5
x <- 5
1:x-1

1: (x-1)
#Don't really know why each are different.  

#solution for example 6
a <- c(1,2,3,4)
seq(along.with = a)

#1,2,3,4

#solution for example 7
#d all of the above 


#solution for example 8
v <- 5:1

#solution for example 9
x <- c(1,2,3,4)
rep(x, 3)

#solution for example 10
x <- c(1,2,3,4)
?rep
rep(x, each = 3)
